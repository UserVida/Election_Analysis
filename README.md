# Election_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to write an automated code in python that can be used to prepare an 
election audit to certify the election results based on the popular vote for American congressional 
and senatorial districts, and American local elections.

In this project, an election audit was performed for the congressional precinct of Colorado using 
the tabulated vote results presented in a csv file. Using python, a script was written to collect
the total number of votes cast, the votes and vote percentage of each candidate, the count and 
percentage of voter turnout for each county, including determining the county with the largest
turnout and finally the election winner. The python script was written, executed and 
saved in VS Code.
