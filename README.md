# Election_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to write an automated code in python that can be used to prepare an 
election audit to certify the election results based on the popular vote for American congressional 
and senatorial districts, and American local elections.

In this project, an election audit was performed for the congressional precinct of Colorado using 
the tabulated vote results presented in a csv file. Using python, a script was written to collect
the total number of votes cast, the votes and vote percentage of each candidate, the count and 
percentage of voter turnout for each county, including determining the county with the largest
turnout and finally the election winner. The python script was written, executed and 
saved in VS Code.

### Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has listed the following tasks to complete the auction audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

The election commission requested additional information on the votes for each county to complete the audit. The following tasks were completed add this information to the audit. 

1. Get a list of the counties in the congressional precinct. 
2. Calculate the total number of votes from each county.
3. Calculate the percentage of votes from each county.
4. Determine the county with the highest voter turnout.
